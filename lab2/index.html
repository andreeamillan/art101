			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge and purpose of this lab was to link HTML and CSS elements together, learning how to stylize and make a page look better. It was also a way to collaborate and learn more about HTML and CSS with someone else.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Initially, some tasks were a bit confusing and I had some trouble with writing the HTML but I asked for help and got through it. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the assignment went well for both of us and we were able to use outside references and what we learned during lecture to our advantage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Ultimately, I think we both did well on the assignment and learned new elements of HTML and CSS.</p>
