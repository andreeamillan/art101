    <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>My name is Soren and I'm currently a 2nd year hoping to double major in legal studies and art. I own a siamese cat and I like fashion and video games.
            My partner's name is Sean and he's currently a third year and has broken his wrist and collarbone before.
