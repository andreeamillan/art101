			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The overall challenge of this lab was formatting pseudocode effectively and figuring out how to work tasks and sub-tasks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble adding some of the lists to my index.html file but I sorted it out. </p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I am now more familiar with pseudocode. Here are the lists we made so far.</p>
					
		<pre><code>	 //How to make Pasta:
		// Grab everything needed: tomato sauce, dry noodles, measuring cups, pot, salt, bowls, stirring spoon, colander, forks. </p>
		// Turn stove to medium heat and place pot down.</p>
			//Add 6 cups of water to the pot.
				//Cover the pot with a lid to speed up heating. 
				//Wait for water to start boiling.
				//Season the water (optional).
				//Add pasta noodles once the water starts to boil.
					//Cook for around 15-20 minutes or until done, stirring occasionally.
					//Once pasta is cooked, take out the colander, place it in the sink, and dump the pasta in.
			//While the pot is still hot, you can make your own sauce, add butter, or just pour the premade tomato sauce.
			//Combine pasta noodles and stir.
			//Serve and enjoy. </code>

	//Rock, Paper, Scissors - Pseudocode Implementation
	//Author: Andreea Millan
	//Date: 10/17/2024

		//Assign a player input box, where they can only choose rock, paper, or scissors.
		//Make a randomizer to have AI choose any element.
			//Accept player input
				//Compare player input to computer-chosen input
					//Test win conditions
					//Win cons are same element = ti 
					//Rock beats scissors
					//Paper beats rock
					//Scissors beats paper
